[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/crop.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/crop)

A Flutter package for cropping any widget, not only images. This package is entirely written in Dart and supports Android, iOS, Web and Desktop. Also, because of being independent from native platform, it does not increase size of your apps output (e.g. apk).

## Supported platforms

* Flutter Android
* Flutter iOS
* Flutter Web (Only with Skia, see below)*
* Flutter Desktop

## Building For Web

In order to run Crop on web, flutter version`1.24.0` or above is needed. Also, you need to set CanvasKit as the renderer with the following command:

```dart
flutter build web --web-renderer canvaskit
```
